# CoolCompiler
Yet another COOL Compiler Project.

# About Cool Language 
Cool the Classroom Object Oriented Language, is a small programming language for teaching the basics of compiler construction to undergraduate computer science majors.  

Cool is designed to be implemented by individuals or teams of two using C++ [Str91] in a Unix environment in a single semester. At Berkeley, 80% - 90% of the student teams complete the pro ject each semester . The project has been designed to be relatively easy to modify so shorter or longer pro jects are possible. 

In this paper, Cool refers both to the language and to the complete compiler project(of which the language is one part).
